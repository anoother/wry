- Proper logging
- Make RESOURCE_URIs a json file?
- Implement native RequestStateChange support...
    - Perhaps source allowed methods for each resource from the schema
- Make invoking instance method more DRY [in progress]
- Add SOL functionality
- Make the operation timeout configurable
- DONE: Reusable options (to stop selectors sticking around, amongst other things.)
